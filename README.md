# Binder

Binder is a small library to help enforce consitent and readable neovim bindings. It does so by adding a ligth morphological layer (reduplication, prefix) and some tools to compose bindings in meaningful ways. It is still mostly for my personal usage, although the code is quite simple and should be easy to understand.
